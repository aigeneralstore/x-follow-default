# Privacy Policy for X.com Follow Tab Default Extension

Last Updated: June 14, 2025

## Introduction

This Privacy Policy describes how the X.com Follow Tab Default Extension ("Extension", "we", "us", or "our") handles information when you use our browser extension.

## Data Collection

Our Extension does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data, browsing history, or user information whatsoever. The Extension operates entirely on your device and performs a single function: redirecting X.com from the "For You" tab to the "Follow" tab.

## Permission Usage

Our Extension requires certain permissions to function properly:

- **Host Permissions** (`*://x.com/*`, `*://www.x.com/*`, `*://twitter.com/*`, `*://www.twitter.com/*`): These permissions are necessary to detect when you visit X.com or Twitter.com and interact with page elements to switch to the "Follow" tab.

- **Scripting**: This permission allows the extension to interact with page elements and click on the "Follow" tab when you visit X.com.

- **WebNavigation**: This permission is used to detect page navigation events within X.com, which is necessary since X.com is a single-page application where traditional page load events don't always trigger.

## Third-Party Services

Our Extension does not use any third-party services, analytics, or tracking tools.

## Data Retention and Deletion

Since our Extension does not collect any data, there is no data retention or deletion policy.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted on this page.
