# X.com Follow Tab Default

Make X.com work for you by automatically switching to the "Follow" tab whenever you open X.com.

## What This Extension Does

This lightweight extension automatically redirects you to the "Follow" tab (formerly "Following") instead of the default "For You" algorithmic feed every time you open X.com. Never see the algorithmic feed unless you choose to!

## Features
• Automatically switches from "For You" to "Follow" tab when opening X.com
• Works on both x.com and twitter.com domains
• Handles page navigation within the site
• Runs efficiently in the background
• No data collection or tracking
• Works with the latest X.com interface

If you prefer seeing posts from accounts you follow in chronological order rather than algorithmically curated content, this extension is for you!
